#to look at the actual code for the git ignore file go to the very bottom


#this is in the main directory so these rules apply to everything you can also put it in sub directories to only affect them with the rules
#the files that i have locally that i dont have uploaded to remote because of ths git ignore file is a basiclog.log file which i set to log all commits using git log and assigning the file to it
#you can use git ignore files to ignore 
#log files
#temporary files
#hidden files
#personal files
#etc
#while this ignores these files git doesnt ignore the gitignore file itself


# - rules for gitignore files
# -- dont use any quotation marks in the code its shown here to show what to write
# -- starting with / says to only do what youve told it to do in the root folder and not every folder
# -- name means name of file, folder means name of folder and file means file name extention just to shorten this key below and lib means libary like a directory
# -- for like all of these there is other ways you can use it just find a list if you want those im too far in and i cant be asked to go back and re edit every single code with more examples

#blank lines are ignored
#lines begining with # are ignored as these are comments
