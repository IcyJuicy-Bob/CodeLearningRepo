-- SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT MODELS --
Traditional models: Waterfall
Prototype models: Rapid Throwaway, Incremental, Evolutionary
Iterative Models: Rapid Application Development (RAD), Spiral, Agile

-- WATERFALL
it's a linear and structured approach where each phase is completed one at a time in order
It needs all requirements to be clearly defined at the start little to no changes allowed once a phase is finished
best suited for projects with fixed requirements and minimal risk of changes

-- RAPID THROWAWAY PROTOTYPE MODEL
involves quickly creating temporary prototypes to explore idead and gather user feedback before finalising the system
prototypes are discarded after they help refine requirements and are especially useful in projects where user needs are initially unclear
suitable when user interaction and efficient interface design are critical

-- INCREMENTAL MODEL
develops a system in small manageable sections each part being designed built and tested individually
functionality is added step by step until the full system is complete
this approach allows for early partial deployment and easier handling of changing requirements over time

-- EVOLUTIONARY PROTOTYPE MODEL
involves building an initail prototype that is continuosly improved based on user feedback until it becomes the final system
the prototype is not discarded but gradually evolves into the full product once the user is satisfied
this model is ideal when user requirements are expected to change or develop over time

-- RAPID APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT (RAD)
focuses on quickly building software through iterative development and frequent user feedback
