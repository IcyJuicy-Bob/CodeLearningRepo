-- JOB ROLES --
developing a new application is rarely a solo project and often involves a team working together
there are seven specific job roles for application development you need to know
for each job role you must understand its main responsibilities and how it contributes to software application development

-- APPLICATION DESIGNER
application designers create the blueprints that guides developers
ensuring the software performs required tasks efficiently and logically

they design the structure and layout of software applications

> designs how its structured
> defines how the software will work (input, outputs and processes)
> works closely with users or analysts to understand requirements
> ensures the design meets both technical and user needs
> produces design documents like flowcharts and network diagrams

-- MOBILE APPLICATION DESIGNER
mobile application designers ensure the software is suitable and user friendly on mobile devices

they design apps specifically for mobile platforms like iOS and android with touch sensitive interfaces
and responsive design


-- PROJECT MANAGER
project managers keep the project organised on track and within budget
making sure all members work efficiently towards the same goals

they must be organised to effectively plan and oversee the entire software development process


-- SYSTEMS ANALYST
systems analysts ensure the final software solves the right problems by fully
understanding what users and businesses actually need

they gather and analyse user requirements and identify possible improvements or new system solutions


-- SYSTEMS DESIGNER
systems designers provide the technical structure of the system
ensuring it functions correctly and efficiently under real world use

they translate requirements into detailed system designs and specify data structures


-- USER EXPERIENCE DESIGNER (UXD)
UXDs ensure the software is pleasant and efficient to use
increasing user satisfaction and reducing errors or frustration

they focus on how users interact with the application
and research user behaviour through testing and feedback


-- USER INTERFACE DESIGNER (UID)
UIDs make the application visually appealing and easy to navigate
supporting a good first impression and smooth interaction

they design the visual elements including the style of buttons, menus, icons and overall layout
