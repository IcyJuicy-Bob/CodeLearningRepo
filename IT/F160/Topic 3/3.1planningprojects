-- PLANNING PROJECTS --

-- IMPORTANCE
> sets clear goals and direction for the project and identifies required resources e.g. time, money, people and tools

- ADVANTAGES
> better organisation
> team members know their roles and tasks
> improves time management as deadlines and milestones keep projects on track

- DISADVANTAGES
> takes time and can delay start of development
> plans may become outdated if requirements change mid project
> avoiding planning leads to higher potential for missed deadlines and overrunning costs due to poor time/budget estimates
> goals may be unclear leading to confusion delays or an unusable product



-- PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS
there are several considerations team members must carefully evaluate in planning phase

- BUDGET
> affects which tools, technologies and staff can be purchased and used
> limited budgets may mean fewer features or slower progress
> overspending can lead to project delays or cancellation

- CONSTRAINTS
limits the project must work within like time cost or staff
> forces developers to make smart choices about what can be done
> can affect the scope quality or delivery time of the final product
> ignoring constraints can lead to project failure or scope creep as costs rise or deadlines are pushed back

- LEGISLATION
make sure they follow the law
> copyright, designs and patents act 1988
> data protection act 2018
> privacy and electronic communications regulations 2003
> failure to follow these laws can result in legal action, fines, app removal, loss of trust and reputation damage

- RESOURCES
refers to people tools and equipment and software needed for the project
> having the right resources improves quality and productivity
> a lack of skilled staff or tools can delay development
> poor resource planning can cause waste or duplication of effort

- SUCCESS CRITERIA
defines what a successful prokect looks like for example user needs making sure its on time and within budget
> helps measure progress and final result ensuring all staff are on task
> guides decision making throughout the project and infulences adjustments
> without clear success criteria the team many deliver the wrong thing or fail to meet user expectations

- TIME
> affects how much can be realistically built and tested within a given timeframe
> tight deadlines may lead to cutting corners or reduced quality and have an impact on final product
> good time planning helps avoid stress selays and missed goals
