-- PERT CHARTS
program evaluation and review technique
maps tasks, their dependencies and timelines in a network diagram
it uses three time estimates optimistic, most likely and pessimistic to calculate espected completion times for each tasks
useful for scheduling complex projects and identifying the critical path to meet deadlines

-- SWOT ANALYSIS
strategic planning tool used to identify a projects strengths, weaknesses, opportunites and threats
