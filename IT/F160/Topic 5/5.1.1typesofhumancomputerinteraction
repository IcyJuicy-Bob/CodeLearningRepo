-- HUMAN COMPUTER INTERACTION / HCI --
the ways in which users engage with computers and is an important factor that must be considered
when designing and developing an application
> Visual
> Audio
> Movement
> Touch

-- VISUAL
graphical user interfaces (GUI) provide a visual interface using windows, icons, buttons and menus
a mouse or trackpad is commonly used to control a pointer to click on these elements
> desktops and laptops
> tablets and smartphones
> kiosks and POS systems
> smart TVs and embedded devices with displays

default choice for most consumer facing applicatons 
required when users expect a friendly intuitive interface
may be influenced by branding or accessibility needs

- ADVANTAGES
> user friendly and accessible to a wide audience
> visual feedback helps guide user behaviour
> supports complex workflows with many windows/ tabs for multitasking

- DISADVANTAGES
> more demanding on system resources than a command line interface (CLI)
> can be cluttered or overwhelming if poorly designed
> slower than CLI for repetitive tasks


command line interfaces (CLI) only allow user interaction with the system by typing text commands into a terminal or shell
if the user has learned how to use them they can be highly efficient for expert tasks and automation but difficult to understand for beginners
> desktops and laptops
> remote servers and virtual machines
> embedded systems with text interfaces

suitable if users are technical e.g. developers or system admins
not appropriate for general or non technical audiences
clients may prefer GUI's for training and support purposes
