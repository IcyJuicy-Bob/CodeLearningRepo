-- HUMAN COMPUTER INTERACTION / HCI --
the ways in which users engage with computers and is an important factor that must be considered
when designing and developing an application
> Visual
> Audio
> Movement
> Touch

-- VISUAL
graphical user interfaces (GUI) provide a visual interface using windows, icons, buttons and menus
a mouse or trackpad is commonly used to control a pointer to click on these elements
> desktops and laptops
> tablets and smartphones
> kiosks and POS systems
> smart TVs and embedded devices with displays

default choice for most consumer facing applicatons 
required when users expect a friendly intuitive interface
may be influenced by branding or accessibility needs

- ADVANTAGES
> user friendly and accessible to a wide audience
> visual feedback helps guide user behaviour
> supports complex workflows with many windows/ tabs for multitasking

- DISADVANTAGES
> more demanding on system resources than a command line interface (CLI)
> can be cluttered or overwhelming if poorly designed
> slower than CLI for repetitive tasks


command line interfaces (CLI) only allow user interaction with the system by typing text commands into a terminal or shell
if the user has learned how to use them they can be highly efficient for expert tasks and automation but difficult to understand for beginners
> desktops and laptops
> remote servers and virtual machines
> embedded systems with text interfaces

suitable if users are technical e.g. developers or system admins
not appropriate for general or non technical audiences
clients may prefer GUI's for training and support purposes

- ADVANTAGES
> powerful and efficient for expert users
> lightweight and uses minimal system resources
> easy to script and automate
> allows for remote management of servers

- DISADVANTAGES
> steep learning curve that requires training to use before starting
> error-prone for beginners
> no visual feedback or discoverability - commands must be known beforehand



-- AUDIO
audio allows users to interact with a the system using voice commands or recieve spoken feedback
speech recognition and text to speach
> smartphones
> smart speakers
> laptops and desktops with microphones
> in car systems

ideal for accessibility focused applications or voice first platforms like smart speakers
may be avoided if clients want quiet enviroments like offices or schools
not suitable if users require visual confirmation or detailed input

- ADVANTAGES
> userful in enviroments where typing or touch is difficult like while cooking
> hands free and accessible for users with visual or mobility impairments
> fast for simple commands

- DISADVANTAGES
> struggles with loud background noise or different accents
> not suitable for detailed or complex inputs
> privacy concerns (always listening)



-- MOVEMENT/GESTURES
uses body movements or gestures like hand waves or head turns
> motion sensors
> AR/VR headsets
> smartphones/tablets
> wearables and smartwatches

suited for interactive entertainment, fitness or AR/VR projects
not practical for traditional office or admin applications
clients must be willing to invest in suitable hardware

- ADVANTAGES
> intuitive and immersive in gaming and virtual reality
> can be hygienic as its touch free
> enhances user experience in interactive installations

- DISADVANTAGES
> can be physically tiring or inaccurate
> not reliable in low light or cramped spaces
> may require additional hardware which could be expensive



-- TOUCH
touch allows users to interact with systems by tapping, swiping or dragging directly on a screen
> smartphones and tablets
> touchscreen laptops and kiosks
> ATMs and POS systems
> interactive whiteboards

ideal for mobile apps or public facing interfaces like fast food ordering or information kiosks
less appropriate for complex desktop applications
must consider accessibility if used by people with mobility challenges

- ADVANTAGES
> fast direct and intuitive for all ages
> space saving no need for a keyboard or mouse
> widely adopted and familiar
> recognises particular interactions

- DISADVANTAGES
> not precise for detailed tasks like image editing
> screens can get smudged or damages
> may not work well with gloves or in cold weather
