-- HUMAN COMPUTER INTERFACE DIAGRAMS --
there are four types of documents/diagrams you need to know that can be used to design human computer interfaces
data flox diagrams, flowcharts, visualisation diagrams and wireframe designs
for each type of diagram you need to know its components and conventions
when it is appropriate for use and how to create it
each diagram is also effective for different uses and you must be able to consider how specific diagrams can be made more effective

-- DATA FLOW DIAGRAMS
a data flow diagram (DFD) is a visual representation of how data is transferred within a system or organisation
they do not show decision logic or sequencing but focus on where data comes from where it goes and how it is processed
DFDs are typically categorised into level 0 and level 1 formats which differ based on complexity

-- FLOWCHARTS
a flowchart is a diagram that shows the sequence of steps in a process using specific symbols
flowcharts can be used as a project planning tool to visualise workflows task order and decision making paths
it is also useful as a human computer interface diagram to show the steps and decisions users may take as they interact with the application

-- VISUALISATION DIAGRAMS
visualisation diagrams are graphical representations used to show the layout structure and appearance of a software applications interface
theyre often used for planning design and feedback purposes
traditionally they would be drawn on paper in pencil and annotated but modern diagrams are mocked up on a computer
so they can be easily shared with team members and clients

-- WIREFRAME DIAGRAMS
wireframe diagrams are basic visual guides used to represent the structure and layout of a user interface without any design styling
they focus on function layout and interaction not aesthetics
wireframe diagrams are used in the early design stages to plan the UI layout before visual design begins
