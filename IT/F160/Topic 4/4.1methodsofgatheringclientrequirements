-- GATHERING CLIENT REQUIREMENTS --
there are 9 methods

-- DOCUMENT ANALYSIS
review documentation to understand current systems, processes or needs
it is used at the start of a project when working with existing systems and when clients have legacy documentation or records
information collected includes technical specifications, user manuals, reports, logs, contracts, process diagrams and compliance and legal documents

- ADVANTAGES
> low cost and non intrusive
> provides deailed and reliable histroical data
> helps spot existing problems and gaps
> saves time if documents are already available

- DISADVANTAGES
> information may be outdated or incomplete
> doesnt capture user opinions or current needs
> requires time to review large volumes of documents


-- FOCUS GROUPS
gather ideas, opinions and feedback from a group of stakeholders or users through guided discussion
used early in the project to explore needs and opinions to collect feedback on a prototype or idea and when user input is important to shape the product
information collected includes user needs and expectations, opinions on features or designs, reactions to mock ups and group preferences or disagreements

- ADVANTAGES
> provides rich detailed feedback
> encourages idea sharing and discussion
> highlighs different viewpoints
> can uncover issues not considered before

- DISADVANTAGES
> can be hard to manage or keep on topic
> some voices may dominate the group and results may not represent all views
> not suitable for very technical or private topics


-- INTERVIEWS
collects detailed information from individuals through structured or semi structured questioning
used to explore specific needs in depth when stakeholders have unique or detailed input and when confidentiality or accuracy is important
information collected includes user goals and preferences specfic requirements or constraints and detailed insights from managers technical staff or users

- ADVANTAGES
> provides in depth tailored responses
> allows follow up questions for clarity
> builds understanding and trust

- DISADVANTAGES
> time consuming to conduct and analyse
> may require skilled interviewers to avoid bias
> only captures the views of a few people per session


-- MEETINGS
brings stakeholders together to discuss requirements priorities and expectations in a formal or informal setting
used at the start of key project stages when decisions need to be made collectively to clarify feedback resp;ve disagreements or update stakeholders
information collected includes agreed requirements and goals stakeholder conflicts or compromises and clarification of needs, roles, timelines and issues

- ADVANTAGES
> encourages collaboration and team input and can help resolve misunderstandings
> quick to gather and confirm information in real time

- DISADVANTAGES
> can go off topic or take too long may be difficult to schedule for all participants
> some participants may not contribute equally
> decisions may be unclear without notes or follow up


-- OBSERVATIONS
watch users interact with current systems and taks to undestand real behaviours not just what users say
used when users may not be able to explain their needs clearly to find usability ussues or inefficiencies and in area where accuracy is imporant for example healthcare
information collected includes actual user behaviour and processes task timings and sequences and errors or confusion not reported by users

- ADVANTAGES
> shows how things are actually done can identify hidden problems and workarounds
> doesnt rely on user memory or opinion reducing bias
> useful for improving usability or workflow

- DISADVANTAGES
> time consuming may require multiple sessions and not suitable for sensitive tasks
> observer effect - people may act differently when watched
> doesnt explain why users behave in certain ways


-- PROBLEM REPORTS
review existing feedback or logs of problems with current systems to identify what needs to be improved
its used when replacing or updating a existing system to understand pain point and when clients already track bugs and issues
information collected includes common user problems and system failures user complaints and frustation points and suggestions or feature requests

- ADVANTAGES
> can guide testing and provide quality improvements
> direct insight into real issues
> focusus development on fixing what matters most
> low cost if the data is already collected

- DISADVANTAGES
> might not capture all problems if users dont report them
> only shows what went wrong not what users want
> may not give the full context needed to solve the issue


-- QUESTIONNAIRES
collect structed information from many users or stakeholders through written questions

information collected includes user demographics ratings or features or priorities mulitple choice or short answer feedback and open ended comments

- ADVANTAGES
> can reach many people quickly and cheaply
> easy to analyse quantitative data statistically
> standardised questions ensure consistency
> allows anonymity encouraging honest answers

- DISADVANTAGES
> limited depth of answers that cant be probed for clarity
> risk of low response rates or biased samples
> poorly worded questions can cause confusion


-- SHADOWING
follow and observe a user closely as they perform their tasks gaining real time insights
used when a detailed understanding of daily user activities is needed to observe workflows and processes and for complex tasks that are hard to decsribe verbally
information collected includes real time actions and decisions, workarounds, interactions with tools and systems and enviromental factors affecting work

- ADVANTAGES
> provides rich contextual understanding
> revreals unspoken challenges or behaviours
> builds empathy for user needs
> userful for identifying workflow improvements

- DISADVANTAGES
> time consuming and resource intensive
> not practical for large numbers of users
> can make users uncomfortable or change behaviour
> requires skilled observers to interpret results


-- SUGGESTION ANALYSIS
collect and review ideas and feedback submitted by users or stakeholders for system improvements or new features
it is used during or after deployment to gather user input to continuously improve a system and when a client wants to encourage user engagement and innovation
information collected includes user suggestions for new features feedback on usability requests for fixes and innovative ideas from diverse perspectives

- ADVANTAGES
> encourages active user participation to build positive relationships with users
> provides real world ideas and priorities to enhance development and uncover creative solutions

- DISADVANTAGES
> may recieve irrelevant or unrealistic suggestions
> can be overwhelming without proper management to review and prioritise ideas
> quality and usefulness of suggestions vary widely
