-- CLIENT REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATIONS
detailed document that outlines what the client needs from a new system
elements include the new system's purpose, functional and non functional requirements, constraints and success criteria

knowing requirements allow for better stimates of time, cost and resources leading to more realistic prject schedules and budgets reducing risk of failure

-- PURPOSE OF the NEW SYSTEM
explains why the system is being developed and what problem it aims to solve
provides an overall focus for the development team

gathered via interviews, meetings and document analysis


-- FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
details what the system must do to achieve the purpose and meet user needs like specific tasks features and behaviours

gathered via interviews questionnaires, focus groups and observation


-- NON FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
specifies system qualities like performance security usability and reliability 
important for the projects success but not directly related to system functions

gathered via interviews, document analysis and client meetings


-- PROCESS CONSTRAINTS
defines limitations on how processes must operate during development like legal rules, or business policies

gathered via document analysis and interviews with managers or compliance teams


-- CURRENT SYSTEM DEFICIENCIES
identifies problems or weakneses in the existing system that the new one must fix or improve upon

gathered via problem reports observation, interviews and document analysis


-- DATA FORMATS
specifies how data is structures, stored and exchanges (e.g. CSV, XML, JSON)
stablishing formats ensures consistency between system components

gathered via document analysis and interviews with technical staff


-- CLIENT AND SOURCE CONTROL
