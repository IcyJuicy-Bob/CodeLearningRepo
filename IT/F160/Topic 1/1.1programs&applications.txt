> smart speakers use programs to process voice commands, control smart home devices and play music based on user intput
> smartphones and tables use mobile apps for communication games and productivity
> AR, VR and MR devices use programs to generate and manage 3D enviroments, track user movemenst and respond to inputs
> Embedded systems like washing machines, smart fridges and cars use programs to manage their operations and interfaces
